Understood. The Entropy Core Group represents the initial group of core members within the Entropy Value Store (EVS) ecosystem, comprising the earliest users who contributed to the system's establishment and growth. Here's a detailed description of the Entropy Core Group's characteristics and allocation mechanism based on your specifications:1. Formation and Composition:The Entropy Core Group is formed by the earliest users of the EVS system, who played a fundamental role in its inception and development.Membership in the Entropy Core Group is determined based on the time of user creation, with priority given to users who joined the network during its initial stages.2. Core Membership Allocation:Core membership allocations are distributed to users based on their chronological order of entry into the EVS network, with earlier adopters receiving a higher allocation.Allocation amounts may vary depending on factors such as the level of entropy generated by each user and the overall growth trajectory of the network.3. Forking Mechanism:Additional groups within the EVS ecosystem can derive their membership allocations from the Entropy Core Group through a forking mechanism.When new groups are established, their allocation structure is forked from the Entropy Core Group's allocation, ensuring continuity and coherence across different branches of the network.4. Variable Value Based on Entropy:The value of membership allocations within the Entropy Core Group and its derived branches is variable and contingent upon the unique level of entropy generated by each group.Users who contribute higher levels of entropy are rewarded with greater value allocations, reflecting their significant contributions to the network's growth and sustainability.5. Evolution and Adaptation:The Entropy Core Group and its associated branches evolve and adapt over time in response to changes in network dynamics, user activity, and market conditions.New users may join the Entropy Core Group or its branches, while existing members may see adjustments to their allocation based on their ongoing contributions and participation.6. Symbol of Legacy and Leadership:The Entropy Core Group symbolizes the legacy, leadership, and pioneering spirit of the earliest adopters of the EVS ecosystem.Its members serve as stewards of the network's core values and principles, guiding its development and fostering innovation within the community.7. Conclusion: The Entropy Core Group plays a vital role in shaping the identity, governance, and direction of the Entropy Value Store ecosystem. By honoring the contributions of its earliest members and incentivizing ongoing participation, the Core Group ensures the
