Entropy Value Store (EVS) Tokenomics Document1. Introduction: The Entropy Value Store (EVS) tokenomics model is designed to create a positive value ecosystem where early adopters are incentivized to contribute to the network's growth and stability. EVS leverages a linear scaling mechanism to determine token worth, with factors such as total users and network participation influencing token value. This document outlines the key components of the EVS tokenomics model, including token distribution, value creation, and incentive structures.2. Token Distribution: EVS tokens are distributed in a fair and transparent manner to incentivize early adoption and participation. The initial token distribution follows these principles:Early Adopters: Members who join the network in its early stages receive a larger share of tokens as a reward for their contribution to network growth.Progressive Allocation: Tokens are distributed progressively over time to reward ongoing participation and contribution.Community Allocation: A portion of tokens is allocated to community initiatives, governance, and ecosystem development.3. Token Worth and Value Creation: The worth of EVS tokens is determined by a linear scaling mechanism that takes into account the following factors:Total Users: The number of users in the network influences token worth, with higher user participation leading to increased token value.Network Participation: Active participation in network activities, such as entropy generation, validation, and governance, contributes to token worth.Entropy Contribution: Users who generate and share entropy data are rewarded with tokens based on the quality and quantity of their contributions.Trade and Liquidity: Token liquidity and trading activity also impact token worth, with higher liquidity leading to increased token value.4. Incentive Structures: EVS incentivizes various forms of participation and contribution through token rewards and incentives:Entropy Generation: Users are rewarded with tokens for generating and sharing entropy data, with higher-quality contributions receiving greater rewards.Network Governance: Token holders have voting rights and decision-making authority over network governance, incentivizing active participation in governance processes.Ecosystem Development: Tokens allocated to community initiatives and ecosystem development fund projects that enhance the EVS ecosystem, attracting new users and increasing token value.5. Rarity and Value Store: EVS tokens become increasingly valuable over time due to their rarity and store of value characteristics:Early adopters hold a higher ratio of tokens relative to total supply, giving their tokens greater rarity and value.Tokens minted in earlier stages of the network's growth have a higher value store, incentivizing long-term holding and investment.6. Conclusion: The EVS tokenomics model creates a positive value ecosystem where early adopters are rewarded for their contribution to network growth and stability. By aligning token worth with factors such as total users, network participation, and entropy contribution, EVS incentivizes active engagement and fosters a vibrant and sustainable community.7. Disclaimer: The EVS tokenomics model is subject to change based on community feedback, network evolution, and regulatory considerations. Participants are encouraged to stay informed and engaged with the EVS community to contribute to the ongoing development and success of the ecosystem.
