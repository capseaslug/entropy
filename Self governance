Understood. Let's refine the reward system based on the distribution of the 51% system ownership and the allocation to users over time. Here's how we can implement it:Reward System Based on Network Size:Initial Distribution: Initially, 51% of the system ownership is allocated to the creators and original stakers. This ownership represents the total supply of tokens in the system.User Allocation: Over time, the allocated tokens are distributed to users based on various factors such as network size, user contributions, and staking activities.Dynamic Distribution: The distribution of tokens is dynamic and depends on the growth and activity of the network. Users who contribute more to the network or hold older core tokens may receive a larger share of the distribution.User Defined Parameters: The creators and original stakers have the authority to define the parameters of the reward system, including the distribution schedule, allocation criteria, and token release mechanisms.Staking Rewards: Users can earn additional rewards by staking their tokens in the network. Staking activities help secure the network and provide incentives for long-term participation.Creation Rewards: New tokens are periodically created and distributed to users as rewards for their contributions to the network. The rate of token creation is variable and may be adjusted based on network conditions and user engagement.Liquidity Draining: As tokens are distributed to users, the liquidity of the system gradually decreases. This process helps align the interests of users with the long-term sustainability and growth of the network.Transparency and Governance: The reward system operates transparently, allowing users to monitor their rewards and participate in governance decisions related to token distribution and network management.By implementing this reward system, we can incentivize user participation, stimulate network growth, and ensure the equitable distribution of token rewards over time. Additionally, the system's transparency and user-defined parameters enhance trust and confidence among network participants.
